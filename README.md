# 👋 Hi, I'm Kamila

Welcome to my small but growing collection of data & NLP projects.

I'm a medical translator turned data person with a background in pharmacovigilance, clinical trials, and language QA. I'm especially drawn to projects that connect medical data, real-world text, and automation.

---

## 🧠 What I'm into

- 🧬 **Medical data meets NLP** - I’m building lightweight tools that classify or extract key information from clinical narratives, e.g. AE descriptions.
- ⚙️ **Automation in healthcare workflows** - exploring ways AI can streamline documentation, reporting, and review processes.
- 🧪 **Evaluation & annotation** - working on projects that involve LLM testing, prompt iteration, and linguistic edge cases.

## 🛠 Recent project highlight

### [`meddra-autocoder`](https://github.com/kamila-in-dataland/meddra-autocoder)
A demo tool for classifying free-text descriptions of adverse events into MedDRA-like categories (SOC / PT / LLT). It uses fuzzy matching and lightweight NLP logic to simulate basic autocoding functionality aimed at showing how patient-facing reporting apps could work under the hood.

## ⚙️ Stack I actually use

- Python, Pandas, spaCy, scikit-learn
- Jupyter, GitHub, VS Code
- XML / JSON / SQL (when I must)
- Playing nicely with dirty medical data

## 🤝 Looking to connect?

I'm open to freelance work in:
- Medical translation (EN-PL), especially clinical and regulatory
- NLP for pharma / life sciences
- Language data QA & evaluation

Or just reach out if you’re building something in the AI-for-health space.
